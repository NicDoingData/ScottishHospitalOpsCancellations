## Installations
The code was written using python 3. Any necessary libraries beyond the standard Anaconda extension are being installed as part of the code.

## Project Motivation
This project was completed as the first project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, and a lot of the methods used are heavily influenced by that degree. It forms the starting point of a very long and steep learning curve for me which also explains any mistakes made. 

In Scotland, capacity issues in the NHS had been on the news recently. This as well as the personal experience of a close personal contact lead me to choose this data set. In particular, I wanted to find out:

1. Have the cancellations of operations for capacity reasons gotten worse?
2. Is the situation the same service-wide or is it limited to certain hospitals?
3. Could we predict how a certain hospital will do in the month to come?

## File Descriptions
Besides this README file, the repository contains the two data files used for this project, as well as the Notebook which contains all code used for this project. 

A blog post summarising the main results is also available and can be found [here].

## Project Interactions
The code contained within the Notebook takes less than a minute to run and can be run start to finish without concern. Explainations, Commentary and conclusions  are provided throughout the notebook.

## License, Acknowledgements, and Authors
No other authors other than myself worked on this project. The data used for this project are collected and distributed by Public Health Scotland freely available [here](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/cancelled-planned-operations/resource/bcc860a4-49f4-4232-a76b-f559cf6eb885) and [here](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/en_GB/dataset/hospital-codes). As noted in the Notebook, Public Health Scotland already conducted some [analysis](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/cancelled-planned-operations/cancelled-planned-operations-month-ending-31-may-2022/) which is referred to in this project, but other than the linked summary, no other analyses was consulted before conducting my own.

Acknowledgements must also go to Udacity, whose Nanodegree in Data Science provided the guidance which was applied for this project

You are free to experiment and use this code as you see fit.
